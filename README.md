# Aviation Projects

This repository contains projects and tools I've made while learning to fly.

# Forms

The following forms were redeveloped with inspiration from existing and common sources, such as FAA's official forms, and ASA and Jeppesen's commercial offerings. I wanted to accomplish a few things:

* Provide a reasonable amount of space for each field based on that field's purpose and expected content. Several of the forms available make some of the fields uncomfortably small, such as the Aircraft Identification.
* Keep the form as simple as possible, using only black and white and a touch of gray, and using simple lines and boxes.
* Re-organize the data to be as logical as possible (although some fields, such as the FAA Flight Plan still follow the usual order to ensure it can be read to a briefer in the right order).
* Ensure there is sufficient space and prompting for all of the various types of information you will need to collect.
* Ensure the printed form can be cut or folded nicely in half to will fit comfortably in a typical kneeboard.
