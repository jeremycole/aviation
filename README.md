# Aviation Projects

This repository contains projects and tools I've made while learning to fly.

# Forms

The following forms were redeveloped with inspiration from existing and common sources, such as FAA's official forms, and ASA and Jeppesen's commercial offerings. I wanted to accomplish a few things:

* Provide a reasonable amount of space for each field based on that field's purpose and expected content. Several of the forms available make some of the fields uncomfortably small, such as the Aircraft Identification.
* Keep the form as simple as possible, using only black and white and a touch of gray, and using simple lines and boxes.
* Re-organize the data to be as logical as possible (although some fields, such as the FAA Flight Plan still follow the usual order to ensure it can be read to a briefer in the right order).
* Ensure there is sufficient space and prompting for all of the various types of information you will need to collect.
* Ensure the printed form can be cut or folded nicely in half to will fit comfortably in a typical kneeboard.

## Flight Plan and Weather Briefing

Collect the relevant information to file a flight plan and receive a weather briefing using 800 WX BRIEF.

## Navigation Log

Plan time, distance, fuel consumption, and navigation points for cross-country trips.

## VOR Check Record

Record the results of aircraft VOR checks required by 14 CFR 91.171.

# Checklists

I have based these on the CheckMate cards (which I like but don't love) and the POH information and checklists (which are generally hard to read and not very compact).

## Diamond DA40

This is based on my plane a 2012 Diamond DA40 XLS with air conditioning and many options. It has been customized a bit for this.

# Airport Diagrams

I have copied the FAA-produced airport diagrams for a few airports so that they print perfectly on a sheet of 8.5x11 paper folded in half, so that the airport diagram is on one side, and an overview map of the area (from Google Maps) is on the reverse.
